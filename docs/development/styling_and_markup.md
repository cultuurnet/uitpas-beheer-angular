# Styling and markup

The [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) language is used for styling. Whenever possible, use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) classes and markup to achieve a clean and user friendly interface.

Standard Bootstrap functionality is not used for the grid system. Refer to the `styles/core/_grid.scss`file to learn how the grid system works.
