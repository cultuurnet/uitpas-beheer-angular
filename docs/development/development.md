# Development

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is used to build and serve the app.

`grunt serve`
* Serves the app on http://localhost:9999
* Livereload is added to reload the browser after file changes.

`grunt build`
* Builds the app to the `dist` folder.
* This process resembles the process for production the most.
