# Development

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is used to build and serve the app.

`grunt serve`
* Serves the app on http://localhost:9999
* Livereload is added to 

`grunt build`
* Builds the app to the `dist` folder. (This will not be available at http://culpas.dev).
* There is a [helper script](helper_scripts.md) that will make the new build available at http://culpas.dev.
