# Language

English is used as much as possible throughout the application code.

There are a few exceptions to this rule:

Brand names like UiTPAS.
Business concepts like Kansenstatuut and Kansentarief; which are rather local/national and thus no exact English equivalent exists.
To ensure these concepts stay clear, their original Dutch name is used.
